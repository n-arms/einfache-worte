# einfache-worte
Finds the most common German words in projekt Gutenberg.

## Motivation
I've been trying (unsuccessfully) to learn German for the past year. Inspired by the book [The Thing Explainer](https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/), I want to try a different approach: memorize the most common words and work from there. It turns out you can say a lot with just 1000 words.
